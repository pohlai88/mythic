# Tailwind CSS Documentation

**Organized using Diátaxis Framework**

This documentation is organized according to the [Diátaxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/), which structures documentation into four distinct types based on user needs:

---

## 📚 Documentation Structure

### 🎓 Tutorials (Learning-Oriented)

**Purpose**: Take you through a series of steps to accomplish something that you have never done before.

- [Building Your First Component with Tailwind CSS v4](./tutorials/01-building-first-component.md)
- [Creating Intelligence-Driven Styling](./tutorials/02-intelligence-driven-styling.md)
- [Setting Up Design Tokens from Figma](./tutorials/03-figma-tokens-setup.md)

**When to use**: You want to learn how to accomplish a task from scratch.

---

### 🔧 How-To Guides (Problem-Oriented)

**Purpose**: Guide you through the steps required to solve a particular problem.

- [How to Style Components with Intelligence](./how-to/01-style-with-intelligence.md)
- [How to Sync Design Tokens from Figma](./how-to/02-sync-figma-tokens.md)
- [How to Create Custom Utilities](./how-to/03-create-custom-utilities.md)
- [How to Migrate from Tailwind v3 to v4](./how-to/04-migrate-v3-to-v4.md)
- [How to Use Dark Mode](./how-to/05-use-dark-mode.md)
- [How to Optimize Tailwind Build Performance](./how-to/06-optimize-build-performance.md)

**When to use**: You know what you want to do, but need guidance on how to do it.

---

### 📖 Reference (Information-Oriented)

**Purpose**: Describe the machinery - how it works, what it does, and what features it has.

- [Design Tokens Reference](./reference/design-tokens.md)
- [Intelligence-Driven Utilities Reference](./reference/intelligence-utilities.md)
- [CSS Utilities Reference](./reference/css-utilities.md)
- [CLI & IntelliSense Reference](./reference/cli-intellisense.md)
- [API Reference](./reference/api-reference.md)

**When to use**: You need to look up specific information about how something works.

---

### 💡 Explanation (Understanding-Oriented)

**Purpose**: Explain and clarify - provide background, context, and understanding.

- [Understanding Tailwind CSS v4 Architecture](./explanation/01-architecture.md)
- [Understanding the Design System Philosophy](./explanation/02-design-system-philosophy.md)
- [Understanding Intelligence-Driven Styling](./explanation/03-intelligence-styling.md)
- [Understanding Figma Integration](./explanation/04-figma-integration.md)
- [Understanding Performance Optimization](./explanation/05-performance-optimization.md)

**When to use**: You want to understand why things work the way they do.

## 📋 Documentation Principles

This documentation follows Diátaxis principles:

1. **Tutorials** use first-person plural ("we") and take you step-by-step
2. **How-to guides** are goal-oriented and problem-focused
3. **Reference** is accurate, complete, and technical
4. **Explanation** provides context and understanding

Each document type serves a different purpose and answers different questions.
