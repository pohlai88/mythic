# Planning Discipline

Before editing:
1) State the goal in 1–2 lines.
2) List the smallest steps to implement.
3) State how we will verify (tests, build, lint, manual check).

Then implement in small commits/patches.

**When to Use Planning Mode:**
- Tasks requiring 3+ distinct steps
- Complex features or refactoring
- Multi-file changes
- Integration work

**Planning Templates:**
- Reference @.cursor/templates/plans/ for reusable templates
- API development: `api-endpoint-plan.md`
- Component creation: `component-plan.md`
- Migration tasks: `migration-plan.md`

**Reference Documentation:**
- @docs/architecture/system-overview.md - Architecture context
- @rules/operational-rules.mdc - Operational standards
