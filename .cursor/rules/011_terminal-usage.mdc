# Terminal Safety

**Terminal Best Practices:**
- Use terminal for: package installs, builds, tests, migrations
- Avoid terminal for: file edits, code generation (use file operations)
- Always verify commands before execution
- Use project-specific scripts from `package.json`

**Safe Commands:**
```bash
# Package management
pnpm install
pnpm add <package>
pnpm remove <package>

# Development
pnpm dev
pnpm build
pnpm test

# Validation
pnpm check
pnpm lint
pnpm type-check
```

**Blocked Commands:**
- `rm -rf` (use file operations instead)
- `git` commands (use Git tools instead)
- Direct file edits (use file operations instead)
- Commands that exfiltrate secrets or run untrusted scripts

**Command Safety Rules:**
- If suggesting a command: explain what it does in one line
- Avoid destructive commands by default (rm -rf, reset --hard, drop db)
- Prefer dry-run options when available
- If a destructive command is truly required, label it clearly as destructive
