# Documentation Edit Scope (Always)

## Allowed Edits

✅ **Structural Changes**
- Add minimal frontmatter (doc_type, status, owner, tags)
- Fix heading hierarchy (# > ## > ### consistent levels)
- Standardize titles (sentence case, no trailing periods)
- Move/rename files (only after approval via MIGRATION_PLAN)

✅ **Content Organization**
- Update internal links (fix broken links, canonical redirects)
- Replace duplicates with references to canonical docs
- Add "superseded by" notices to legacy docs
- Create stub files for redirects

✅ **Metadata**
- Add/update frontmatter (YAML)
- Add tags for discoverability
- Add ownership information
- Add creation/modification dates

## Forbidden Edits

❌ **Style/Language Changes**
- Stylistic rewriting (unless explicitly requested)
- Grammar/tone polishing (content preservation priority)
- Emoji additions (unless user requests)
- Formatting beautification (unless fixing errors)

❌ **Content Changes**
- Changing meaning of content
- Removing sections (unless consolidating duplicates with approval)
- Merging multiple documents (without explicit approval)
- Adding new content (restructure only, not content creation)

❌ **Destructive Operations**
- Deleting files (move to .cursor/archive/ instead)
- Overwriting without git history (always use git mv)
- Removing historical information (archive instead)

---

## Decision Tracking

Every structural change MUST be recorded in `docs/_system/DECISIONS.md`:

```markdown
## D-XXXX (YYYY-MM-DD) — [Decision Title]

**Decision**: [What was decided]
**Rationale**: [Why]
**Impacts**: [What changes]
**Approved by**: [Who/when]
**Status**: [PROPOSED|APPROVED|IMPLEMENTED]
```

---

## Contradiction Handling

If you detect conflicting information:

1. ❌ DO NOT auto-resolve
2. ✅ DO log in `docs/_system/CONTRADICTIONS.md`
3. ✅ DO present options with recommendations
4. ✅ DO wait for stakeholder approval

---

## Non-Destructive Principle

**Priority**: Preserve > Reorganize > Polish

- Always move files via git (preserves history)
- Always create stubs at old locations (redirects)
- Always validate links before committing
- Always batch operations with verification steps
