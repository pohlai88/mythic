# TypeScript Standards

- No `any` unless explicitly justified; prefer `unknown` + narrowing.
- Prefer explicit return types for public functions and exported utilities.
- Avoid type-level cleverness that reduces readability.
- Keep types close to usage; shared types go in `types/` or `lib/types/`.

**If adding new API shapes, define:**
- Request/response types
- Error shape
- Validation strategy (runtime validation if external input)

**Type Safety Rules:**
- No implicit `any`
- Explicit return types for public functions
- Use `unknown` + narrowing instead of `any`
- Keep types readable and maintainable

**Type Organization:**
- Keep types close to usage
- Shared types in `types/` or `lib/types/`
- Define API shapes explicitly
- Use runtime validation for external input
