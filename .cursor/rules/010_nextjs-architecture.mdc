# Next.js Architecture Rules

- Default to App Router conventions (`app/`), with colocated routes/layouts.
- Prefer Server Components by default; only use `"use client"` when required.
- Keep data-fetching/server-only code out of Client Components.
- For route structure and file conventions, follow Next.js project structure guidance.
- Use `next lint` for lint workflow when present.

**When proposing files, use a clear Next.js layout:**
- `app/(group)/...` for route groups
- `app/api/...` for route handlers (when needed)
- `components/` for reusable UI
- `lib/` for pure utilities and server/client helpers
