# Planning Mode Guidelines

**When to Use Planning Mode:**
- Tasks with 3+ distinct steps
- Complex features requiring multiple files
- Integration work across modules
- Refactoring that affects multiple components

**Planning Process:**
1. Reference @docs/architecture/system-overview.md in plans
2. Break down complex features into actionable todos
3. Validate plans against existing patterns before execution
4. State the goal in 1–2 lines
5. List the smallest steps to implement
6. State how we will verify (tests, build, lint, manual check)

**Plan Templates:**
- API development: `@.cursor/templates/plans/api-endpoint-plan.md`
- Component creation: `@.cursor/templates/plans/component-plan.md`
- Migration tasks: `@.cursor/templates/plans/migration-plan.md`

**Reference Documentation:**
- @rules/010_planning.mdc - Core planning discipline
- @docs/architecture/system-overview.md - Architecture context
