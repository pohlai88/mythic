# Large Codebase Optimization

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Incremental codebase indexing
- Focused context windows
- Module-based development
- Lazy loading patterns
- Code splitting strategies

**Large Codebase Best Practices:**
- Use @Codebase for targeted searches
- Break down large tasks into modules
- Use Planning mode for complex features
- Optimize rule scope with globs
- Use incremental indexing

**Performance Considerations:**
- Avoid changes that increase build time unless required
- Prefer lazy-loading and targeted imports
- Narrow dependency additions
- Justify new dependencies and consider minimal alternatives
- Use code splitting for large bundles

**Module-Based Development:**
- Break down large features into modules
- Use clear module boundaries
- Minimize cross-module dependencies
- Use lazy loading for large modules

**Indexing Optimization:**
- Use incremental indexing
- Focus on frequently accessed files
- Exclude unnecessary files from index
- Optimize index refresh frequency

**Context Management:**
- Use focused context windows
- Reference specific files when possible
- Use @Codebase for targeted searches
- Break down large tasks into smaller ones
