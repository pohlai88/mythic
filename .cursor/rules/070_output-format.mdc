# Output Format

When delivering work, structure as:
1) What changed (bullet list)
2) Files touched (list)
3) How to verify (commands / steps)
4) Notes / tradeoffs (if any)

**Output Formats by Task Type:**
- **Diffs** - For code changes (always show diffs)
- **Files** - For new files (show complete file)
- **Plans** - For complex tasks (structured plan with todos)
- **Summaries** - For reviews (checklist format)

**Format Rules:**
- Always show diffs for code changes
- Use structured output for plans
- Include code examples in documentation
- Format output for readability
- Reference concrete paths: `src/...`, `app/...`, etc.

**For Code Changes:**
1) Summary (what changed)
2) Files touched (list)
3) Patch (file-by-file code blocks)
4) How to verify (commands + expected outcomes)
5) Notes / tradeoffs (if any)
