1) What changed (bullet list)
2) Files touched (list)
3) How to verify (commands / steps)
4) Notes / tradeoffs (if any)

**Output Formats by Task Type:**

- **Diffs** - For code changes
  - Always show diffs for code changes
  - Use file-by-file format
  - Include context lines

- **Files** - For new files
  - Show complete file content
  - Include file path
  - Add appropriate comments

- **Plans** - For complex tasks
  - Structured plan with todos
  - Break down into steps
  - Include verification criteria

- **Summaries** - For reviews
  - Checklist format
  - Include findings
  - Provide recommendations

**Format Rules:**
- Always show diffs for code changes
- Use structured output for plans
- Include code examples in documentation
- Format output for readability
- Reference concrete paths: `src/...`, `app/...`, etc.

**For Code Changes:**
1) Summary (what changed)
2) Files touched (list)
3) Patch (file-by-file code blocks)
4) How to verify (commands + expected outcomes)
5) Notes / tradeoffs (if any)
