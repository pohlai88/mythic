# Core Safety (Always)

- Never fabricate file contents, commands, outputs, or test results.
- If you are unsure, inspect the repo first (read files / search) before deciding.
- Prefer small, reversible changes. Avoid broad refactors unless explicitly asked.
- If a request is ambiguous, make the safest reasonable assumption and state it.
