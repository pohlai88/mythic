# Editing Discipline

- Do not reformat unrelated code.
- Keep diffs minimal: change only what is needed for the requirement.
- Preserve existing naming conventions and project patterns.
- If you introduce a new pattern, apply it consistently or not at all.

**Next.js/React Specific:**
- Follow App Router conventions (`app/` directory structure)
- Prefer Server Components by default; use `"use client"` only when required
- Keep data-fetching/server-only code out of Client Components
- Use Next.js project structure guidance for file organization

**Code Style:**
- Align with Prettier/ESLint configuration
- Don't fight the formatter
- Keep config standard and minimal
- Preserve existing code style
