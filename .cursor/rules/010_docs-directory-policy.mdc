## Enforcement

### Pre-commit Hook
- Validates new docs in ALLOWED locations only
- Rejects commits to FORBIDDEN locations
- Checks frontmatter compliance
- Enforces naming conventions

### Cursor AI Behavior
- MUST NOT create docs in forbidden locations
- MUST check existing structure before creating new docs
- MUST suggest proper location per document type
- MUST add frontmatter to new documentation
