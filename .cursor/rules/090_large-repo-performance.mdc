# Large Repo Discipline

- Avoid changes that increase build time unless required.
- Prefer lazy-loading, targeted imports, and narrow dependency additions.
- If adding a new dependency, justify it and consider the minimal alternative.

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Incremental codebase indexing
- Focused context windows
- Module-based development
- Lazy loading patterns
- Code splitting strategies

**Large Codebase Best Practices:**
- Use @Codebase for targeted searches
- Break down large tasks into modules
- Use Planning mode for complex features
- Optimize rule scope with globs
- Use incremental indexing

**Performance Considerations:**
- Avoid changes that increase build time unless required
- Prefer lazy-loading and targeted imports
- Narrow dependency additions
- Justify new dependencies and consider minimal alternatives
- Use code splitting for large bundles
