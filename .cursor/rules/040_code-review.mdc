# Code Review Checklist (Self)

Before final output, verify:
- Correctness: logic matches requirement, no silent behavior change.
- Security: no secrets in code; no unsafe defaults.
- Reliability: error handling is reasonable; edge cases considered.
- Maintainability: names clear; comments only where needed.
- Tests: add/update where appropriate; at least explain manual verification.

**Next.js Specific Checks:**
- Server/client boundary respected
- No `any` type creep
- Error handling is explicit
- API routes properly structured
- Components follow App Router conventions

**Review Process:**
- Enable automatic diff review before applying changes
- Set up review checklist for security, performance, patterns
- Integrate with BugBot for automated code review (when available)
- Use Review mode for complex refactoring

**BugBot Integration:**
- Configure BugBot for automatic code review
- Set severity thresholds
- Integrate with pre-commit hooks
- Review BugBot findings before merging
