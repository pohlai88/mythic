# Tools & Context Use

- If the task involves existing code: read relevant files first (don't guess).
- When you change behavior, point to the exact file(s) and key lines/sections.
- Prefer "surgical edits" over rewriting whole files.
- If you need new files, propose names/paths before creating them.

**Tool Categories:**
1. **File Operations** - Read, write, search files (preferred for code changes)
2. **Terminal** - Shell commands, package management (use for installs, builds, tests)
3. **Browser** - Web testing, scraping (use for E2E testing)
4. **MCP Tools** - External integrations (use for GitHub, Supabase, etc.)
5. **Git** - Version control operations (use Git tools, not raw git commands)

**Tool Usage Rules:**
- Always use file operations for code changes (not terminal)
- Use terminal only for: package installs, builds, tests, migrations
- Use browser for testing web functionality
- Use Git tools for version control (not raw git commands)
- Log tool usage for audit trail
