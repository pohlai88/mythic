Haha 😄 yeah — **“come come”** is exactly the right reaction.

Let me make this **practical**, not theoretical.

Here is how you actually run **Cursor + ChatGPT** so the AI stays **smart all day** instead of going stupid.

---

# 🧩 The Physical Setup (this matters)

You should have **at least 4 tabs** open:

| Tab | Tool              | Name it   |
| --- | ----------------- | --------- |
| 1   | ChatGPT (browser) | **ARCH**  |
| 2   | ChatGPT (browser) | **SPEC**  |
| 3   | Cursor Chat       | **BUILD** |
| 4   | Cursor Chat       | **DEBUG** |

Yes — literally separate browser tabs and Cursor chats.

This is **AI hygiene**.

# 🧠 What goes where

## 🧱 ARCH (ChatGPT)

Use this for:

* System architecture
* Data models
* Governance
* Design language
* Decisions

Example:

> “Design my permission model for NexusCanon”

Never paste:

* Error logs
* Stack traces
* 500 lines of code

This chat must stay clean.

---

## 📜 SPEC (ChatGPT)

Use this for:

* PRDs
* Feature definitions
* Acceptance criteria
* Business logic
* Rules

This becomes your **source of truth**.

Example:

> “Write the PRD for CEO Ticket System v2”

---

## 🛠 BUILD (Cursor)

Only:

* “Implement X from the spec”
* “Refactor this file”
* “Create API endpoint”
* “Generate UI”

This chat should only see:

* Code
* The current task
* Relevant files

Not:

* Long discussions
* Business debate

---

## 🧪 DEBUG (Cursor)

New chat. Clean slate.

Only paste:

* Errors
* Failing tests
* Logs

Example:

> “Here is the error. Fix it.”

No old instructions. No spec. No history.

This keeps the model in **surgical mode**.

---

# 🔥 The most important rule

When Cursor starts:

* Forgetting things
* Repeating itself
* Breaking architecture
* Doing weird stuff

You do NOT argue.

You do this:

> Close the chat
> Open a new one
> Paste the spec + current file
> Continue

That is how you restore intelligence.

---

# 🧠 Why this works

Because you are controlling:

* What the AI remembers
* What it forgets
* What it focuses on

You are no longer letting the context window rot.

---

# ⚡ This is how people build 100k-line systems with AI

Not by “better prompting”.

By **memory architecture**.

---

If you want, tell me:

* Are you mainly coding now?
* Or designing systems?

I can give you the **exact prompt templates** for each thread so you can copy–paste and run this like a pro. 🚀
