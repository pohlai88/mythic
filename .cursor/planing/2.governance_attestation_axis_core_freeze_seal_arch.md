## 4. Governance Assertions

The attesting authorities assert that:

1. **Core Law Freeze**  
   AXIS Product Constitution v1.0 and Semantic Registry Spec v1.0 are frozen at Draft–Stable status. Silent modification is prohibited.

2. **Semantic Integrity**  
   Meaning authority is singular, declared, versioned, and non-retroactive. Unregistered semantics are invalid.

3. **Appendix Discipline**  
   Appendices are informative and additive only. They SHALL NOT override or redefine core law.

4. **Anti-Drift Guarantees**  
   Amendment triggers, versioning rules, and visibility requirements are explicitly defined.

5. **Ledger Readiness**  
   All attested artifacts are hashable, sealable, and eligible for public ledger anchoring.

---

## 5. Non-Retroactivity & Limitations

This attestation:
- applies prospectively only
- does not invalidate any prior actions
- does not activate enforcement or runtime behavior

Implementation and Titan enforcement remain subject to separate governance actions.

---

## 6. Next Procedural Step (Informational)

Following this attestation, the remaining procedural steps are:

1. Compute canonical hashes for attested artifacts
2. Populate and append the `CORE_FREEZE_SEAL` public ledger entry
3. Confirm seal integrity via governance rollup

These steps are operational and do not alter the substance of this attestation.

---

## 7. Attestation Closure

This document serves as the **formal governance attestation** that the AXIS core governance framework is complete, sealed, and ready for ledger anchoring.

Any future changes SHALL occur only through additive, ledger-recorded amendments.
