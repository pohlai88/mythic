# Appendix-B — Vocabulary Governance (Non-Binding)

**Status:** Informative — Not Constitutional  
**Parent Authority:** Semantic Registry Spec v1.0 (ARCH)  
**Scope:** Controlled vocabularies for CLASSIFICATION and THRESHOLD registry records  
**Authority Level:** Non-binding appendix (vocabulary governance)  
**Operating Rule:** Vocabularies MAY be declared. They SHALL NOT be enforced unless elevated.

---

## B.1 Purpose

This appendix defines how **controlled vocabularies** may be declared and governed within the Semantic Registry.

Its purpose is to:
- prevent accidental divergence of meaning
- support consistency across AXIS and Titan surfaces
- preserve a single source of declared semantics

This appendix governs **vocabulary discipline**, not enforcement.

---

## B.2 Vocabulary Scope

Vocabulary governance applies to registry records of type:

- `CLASSIFICATION`
- `THRESHOLD`

Other record types are out of scope.

---

## B.3 Vocabulary Declaration Rules

### B.3.1 Language Stability

Definitions SHALL be language-stable:
- no synonyms with divergent meaning
- no ambiguous or metaphorical phrasing
- no context-dependent interpretation

Each definition SHALL stand alone.

---

### B.3.2 Uniqueness Constraint

For a given `record_type`:
- only one active record with a given `name` MAY exist at any effective date
- divergent definitions under the same name are prohibited

Supersession is the only allowed evolution path.

---

## B.4 Supersession Semantics (Forward-Only Lineage)

Supersession:
- SHALL be forward-only
- SHALL reference the immediate predecessor
- SHALL NOT retroactively alter prior records

Historical meanings remain valid for their effective periods.

---

## B.5 Evidence Discipline (Optional Extension)

Registry entries MAY reference evidence by category (e.g. `primary`, `secondary`) via an appendix-level extension.

Such categorization:
- is descriptive only
- SHALL NOT affect validity or enforcement
- SHALL NOT be mandatory unless elevated

---

## B.6 Effective Date Resolution

Where system time is unreliable, runtime resolution MAY use:
- effective date (`effective_from`), or
- immutable ledger position

Resolution rules SHALL be declared explicitly and consistently.

---

## B.7 Visibility & Reporting

Governance rollups MAY include:
- vocabulary additions
- supersession lineage chains
- duplicate-name prevention events

These reports are informational unless elevated.

---

## B.8 Non-Goals

This appendix SHALL NOT:
- introduce inference or semantic derivation
- define scoring, weighting, or ranking
- impose enforcement logic

---

## B.9 Stability Clause

This appendix may evolve independently.

Changes SHALL NOT affect constitutional or schema baselines unless promoted.
