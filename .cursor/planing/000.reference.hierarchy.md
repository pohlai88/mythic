Got it — you’re asking **“who are the canonical industry references I should
anchor to”**, not _what internal docs to write_. In other words: **which
authorities are worth citing, indexing, and treating as ‘law’ inside the IDE**.

Below is the **clean, industry-grade answer**. No fluff.

---

## The correct way to think about this

In real-world engineering, **best practice ≠ copying one tool**.

Best practice is:

> **Each layer of the stack has a canonical authority.**

Your IDE index should therefore reference **one authority per layer**, not
everything.

---

# Canonical Reference Pillars (WHO to refer to)

## 1️⃣ Core UI Framework Authority

### ✅ **React (Official)**

**Why React is the pillar**

- Defines component lifecycle, hooks, rendering model
- Everything else _adapts_ to React

**IDE Index Should Treat As**

> **UI Execution Law**

**Index**

- React Official Docs
- React RFCs (hooks, concurrent features)
- React compiler / server components (if used)

❌ Do NOT treat UI libraries as peers to React

---

## 2️⃣ Styling & Design Token Authority

### ✅ **Tailwind CSS (Official)**

**Why Tailwind is the pillar**

- Industry-accepted utility + token bridge
- Works with _any_ design system
- Strong constraints = consistency

**IDE Index Should Treat As**

> **Styling Grammar & Token Transport**

**Index**

- Tailwind core docs
- Configuration reference (`theme`, `extend`)
- JIT behavior & performance notes

⚠️ Tailwind is **not** your design system It is the **carrier**.

---

## 3️⃣ Design System Authority

### ✅ **Figma (Industry Standard)**

**Why Figma**

- De facto design-to-engineering handoff standard
- Tokens, variants, auto-layout = real production workflows

**IDE Index Should Treat As**

> **Visual Source of Truth**

**Index**

- Design tokens spec (colors, spacing, typography)
- Component variants mapping
- Interaction states

❗ Figma defines _intent_, not implementation

---

## 4️⃣ Component API Quality Authority

### ✅ **Radix UI (Reference, not dependency)**

**Why Radix**

- Best-in-class API design
- Accessibility-first, unstyled primitives
- Teaches _how components should be shaped_

**IDE Index Should Treat As**

> **Component API Gold Standard**

**Index**

- Radix component contracts
- Accessibility patterns
- Controlled/uncontrolled component design

You don’t need to use Radix — **you learn from it**.

---

## 5️⃣ Accessibility Authority

### ✅ **W3C / WCAG**

**Why**

- Legal + ethical standard
- No company overrides this

**IDE Index Should Treat As**

> **Non-Negotiable Constraint Layer**

**Index**

- WCAG 2.1 / 2.2 rules
- ARIA practices
- Keyboard navigation patterns

---

## 6️⃣ Documentation & Knowledge Architecture Authority

### ✅ **Diátaxis Framework**

**Why**

- Used by major open-source & enterprise teams
- Prevents doc sprawl and confusion

**IDE Index Should Treat As**

> **Documentation Structure Law**

**Index**

- Tutorials
- How-to guides
- Reference
- Explanation

---

## 7️⃣ Engineering Governance Authority

### ✅ **ADR (Architecture Decision Records)**

**Why**

- Industry standard for “why we chose this”
- Auditable and future-proof

**IDE Index Should Treat As**

> **Decision Ledger**

**Index**

- ADR template
- Accepted / superseded decisions
- Tradeoff records

---

## 8️⃣ State & Data Flow Authority

### ✅ **React Query / TanStack (Reference)**

**Why**

- Canonical async/state patterns
- Separation of server vs UI state

**IDE Index Should Treat As**

> **Data Flow Reference**

You may not use it directly — but your patterns should align.

---

## 9️⃣ Tables & Dense Data Authority

### ✅ **TanStack Table / Mantine React Table**

**Why**

- Tables are not “components”, they are **systems**
- Sorting, filtering, virtualization are solved problems

**IDE Index Should Treat As**

> **High-Density Data Pattern Reference**

---

## 🔟 Build & Quality Authority

### ✅ **Vite / TypeScript / ESLint / Prettier**

**Why**

- Defines dev experience & correctness
- Industry default

**IDE Index Should Treat As**

> **Execution & Quality Baseline**

---

# The golden rule (this matters)

You do **NOT** index:

- PrimeReact docs
- React Bootstrap docs
- React Suite docs

Those are **implementation choices**, not authorities.

You index:

- **React**
- **Tailwind**
- **Figma**
- **WCAG**
- **Radix (API design reference)**
- **Diátaxis**
- **ADR**

---

## If you want, next step

I can:

- Propose a **clean IDE doc index tree** (`/docs/_reference/…`)
- Or map **Figma tokens → Tailwind tokens → React components**
- Or tell you **which libraries to ban from the repo** to preserve purity

Just say which direction.
