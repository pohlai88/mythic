# AXIS Governance — Master Tracking Page (Single‑Page View)

**Status:** Authoritative Tracking · Post‑Seal  
**Authority:** System Architect Office · Governance Secretariat  
**Purpose:** One‑page, unambiguous view of what is **Available**, **Sealed**,
**Pending Execution**, and **Intentionally Omitted**.

---

## 1. GOVERNANCE STATE (AT A GLANCE)

**Design Phase:** COMPLETE  
**Governance Phase:** SEALED  
**Execution Phase:** IN PROGRESS (System‑handled)

> Law and meaning are frozen. Only execution and bounded new development remain.

---

## 2. SEALED CORE (BINDING · DRAFT–STABLE)

These artifacts are **law‑level** and SHALL NOT change without explicit
amendment.

| ID   | Artifact                       | Role                        | Status |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------ |
| S‑01 | AXIS Product Constitution v1.0 | Product‑law authority       | SEALED |
| S‑02 | Semantic Registry Spec v1.0    | Canonical meaning authority | SEALED |

---

## 3. FREEZE, SEAL & ATTESTATION (PROCEDURAL · SEALED)

These establish **institutional finality** and audit readiness.

| ID   | Artifact                  | Purpose               | Status                |
| ---- | ------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| P‑01 | Freeze Core Declaration   | Freeze law & meaning  | SEALED                |
| P‑02 | Seal & Ledger Declaration | Cryptographic binding | SEALED (Ledger‑Ready) |
| P‑03 | Official Seal Register    | Canonical seal list   | SEALED                |
| P‑04 | Governance Attestation    | Formal closure        | SEALED                |

---

## 4. APPENDICES (GOVERNED · NON‑BINDING)

Additive extensions. SHALL NOT override core law.

| ID   | Appendix                                | Scope                      | Status       |
| ---- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------ |
| A‑01 | Appendix‑A — Decision Metadata          | Optional schema extensions | SEALED       |
| A‑02 | Appendix‑B — Vocabulary Governance      | Language discipline        | Draft–Stable |
| A‑03 | Appendix‑C — Vocabulary Registry Format | Canonical structure        | Draft–Stable |

---

## 5. LEDGER EXECUTION (READY · SYSTEM‑HANDLED)

Structurally complete. Awaiting cryptographic execution.

| Step | Item                          | Status           |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
| L‑01 | Compute artifact hashes       | Pending (System) |
| L‑02 | CORE_FREEZE_SEAL ledger entry | Prepared         |
| L‑03 | Ledger append                 | Pending          |
| L‑04 | Integrity verification        | Pending          |
| L‑05 | Weekly rollup update          | Pending          |

---

## 6. AVAILABLE FOR USE (NOW)

The following may be relied upon immediately:

- Product law invariants (AXIS Constitution)
- Meaning registration rules (Semantic Registry)
- Vocabulary structure & governance (Appendix‑B, C)
- Decision metadata extensions (Appendix‑A)

---

## 7. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED (DO NOT BUILD)

These are **explicitly excluded** to prevent over‑engineering:

- ❌ Workflows / approval engines
- ❌ UX / UI / visual rules
- ❌ Enforcement activation (Titan gates)
- ❌ Ontologies, inference, AI‑derived semantics
- ❌ Default vocabularies or thresholds
- ❌ Runtime architecture (DB, events, transactions)
- ❌ Commercial pricing / SKUs

> Absence is intentional. Silence ≠ permission.

---

## 8. NEXT GOVERNED DEVELOPMENT (ONLY ONE)

**NEXT PAGE:** **Atomic Commit Contract v1 (ARCH)**

**Why:**

- Law and meaning are sealed
- Atomicity is the next invariant required for enforcement
- All runtime correctness depends on it

**Boundary:** MVP only · No workflow engines · No platform redesign

---

## 9. RULE OF CHANGE

If it is not listed here:

- it is not sealed
- it is not binding
- it must not be assumed

All changes require explicit governance action.
