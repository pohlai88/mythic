# Seal & Ledger Declaration — Core Freeze Binding (🧱 ARCH)

**Status:** Draft — Prepared for Ledger Append  
**Scope:** Cryptographic binding of Draft–Stable core artifacts  
**Authority:** Governance Secretariat under NexusCanon  
**Operating Rule:** Additive only · Hash-bound · Publicly verifiable

---

## 1. Purpose

This declaration **seals and binds** the Draft–Stable core governance artifacts to immutable cryptographic references.

It exists to:
- anchor the Draft–Stable freeze to specific artifact versions
- prevent silent modification or substitution
- prepare the governance state for public ledger append

This declaration is **procedural**, not doctrinal.

---

## 2. Ratifying Authority

This declaration is ratified by:

- **System Architect Office** — architectural authority
- **Governance Secretariat** — procedural authority

Ratification signifies that the referenced artifacts are complete, internally consistent, and eligible for ledger anchoring.

---

## 3. Artifacts Sealed (Hash-Bound)

The following artifacts are hereby sealed at **Draft–Stable** status:

### 3.1 AXIS Product Constitution v1.0 (🧱 ARCH)

- `artifact_name`: AXIS Product Constitution v1.0
- `artifact_role`: Product-law authority
- `artifact_hash`: HASH_PLACEHOLDER

---

### 3.2 Semantic Registry Spec v1.0 (🧱 ARCH)

- `artifact_name`: Semantic Registry Specification v1.0
- `artifact_role`: Canonical meaning authority
- `artifact_hash`: HASH_PLACEHOLDER

---

### 3.3 Freeze Core Declaration — Draft–Stable Marking

- `artifact_name`: Freeze Core Declaration — Draft–Stable Marking
- `artifact_role`: Core freeze directive
- `artifact_hash`: HASH_PLACEHOLDER

---

## 4. Binding Effect

From the ledger append onward:

- Any modification to the sealed artifacts SHALL require explicit amendment.
- Any attempt to bypass, replace, or silently alter the sealed artifacts SHALL be treated as a **Product Authority Violation**.
- Violations SHALL be recorded, escalated, and annotated for audit.

---

## 5. Ledger Append Readiness

This declaration is eligible for public ledger append as a **SEALING_EVENT**.

Required fields for ledger entry:
- `entry_type`: CORE_FREEZE_SEAL
- `sealed_artifacts[]`: name + hash pairs
- `ratifying_authority`
- `effective_ledger_position`

---

## 6. Visibility & Rollup Integration

Governance rollups MAY include:
- confirmation of sealed artifact hashes
- periodic freeze integrity checks
- detection of any post-seal modification attempts

---

## 7. Non-Retroactivity

This sealing applies prospectively.

All actions taken prior to the ledger append remain valid under the governance rules in effect at the time.

---

## 8. Stability Clause

Once sealed, silence SHALL NOT imply permission.

Only additive, ledger-recorded amendments may alter the sealed state.
