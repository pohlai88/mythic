# AXIS Governance — Planning & Tracking Playbook

> This document is **not governance law**.  
> It exists to track status, sequence work, and externalise drafting safely.  
> Sealed artifacts are read‑only references.

**Next Action:** Compute registry document hash and apply patch set.  
**Decision Required:** Approve Pre‑HITL draft for Atomic Commit Contract v1.0.

## 1. Orientation Snapshot

**Current State**

- Design Phase: **COMPLETE**
- Governance Phase: **SEALED**
- Execution Phase: **IN PROGRESS (System‑handled)**

**Rule of Authority**  
If it is not **Sealed**, it is **not binding**. Planning content never creates
authority.

## 2. Authority Layers

| Layer | Description                | Mutability            |
| ----- | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| L0    | Canon (Universal Doctrine) | Immutable             |
| L1    | AXIS Product Law           | Immutable (post‑seal) |
| L2    | Operational Planning       | Mutable               |

## 6. Backlog — Declared Governance Deliverables (L2)

### 6.1 Atomic Commit Contract v1.0 (ARCH)

- **Purpose:** Declare atomic truth boundaries
- **Scope:** Templates only (PO, GRN, Invoice, JE, Reversal)
- **Non‑Goals:** Workflow engines; event sourcing redesign

### 6.2 AXIS Significance Policy v1.0 (ARCH + SPEC)

- **ARCH:** Ownership, ledgering, effective dating
- **SPEC:** Runtime friction behaviour; acceptance criteria

### 6.3 Market Decision Record DR‑001 (ARCH)

- **Purpose:** Lock market positioning
- **Boundary:** Explicit exclusions required

---

## 7. Enforcement Preview (Planning‑Only)

- Registry registration: rule must be registered
- Decision metadata completeness
- Atomic commit provenance validation
- Threshold version and effective‑date lookup

---

## 8. AI Externalisation Toolkit

All outputs are **planning drafts** unless explicitly ratified.

### ARCH Prompt

```
Role: System Architect
Context: Planning only; sealed governance is read‑only.
Task: Produce an ARCH summary for [NAME + SHORT CONTEXT].
Deliverable:
1) Invariants (verbatim)
2) Non‑Goals (verbatim)
3) MVP Boundary (concise)
4) Enforcement Surface (Titan checks)
5) 3 Next Actions
Tone: Precise; preserve original wording for invariants and amendment triggers.
```

### SPEC Prompt

```
Role: Product & Spec Engine
Context: Planning draft only.
Task: Convert [FEATURE / POLICY] into a SPEC with:
1) Behaviour rules
2) Acceptance criteria (GIVEN/WHEN/THEN)
3) Required fields / schema
4) Edge cases
5) Test checklist
Tone: Deterministic; no implementation details.
```

### BUILD Prompt

```
Role: Senior Engineer (Cursor)
Context: Implementation must follow approved spec exactly.
Task: Produce minimal diffs or files for [COMPONENT].
Include:
1) Patch / diff
2) Migration notes (if any)
3) Rollback steps
Rules: Do not invent architecture; do not change unrelated files.
```

### DEBUG Prompt

```
Role: Debug‑mode engineer
Context: Surgical fix only.
Task:
1) Root‑cause diagnosis
2) Minimal fix (diff)
3) Validation test
4) Reversion plan
Rules: No refactor; no redesign.
```

---

## 9. Explicit Non‑Scope

The following SHALL NOT be planned or built here:

- Workflow or approval engines
- UX / UI or visual rules
- Enforcement activation logic
- Ontologies or inference systems
- Runtime architecture or storage
- Commercial pricing or SKUs

> Silence does not imply permission.

---

## 10. Change Discipline

- This playbook MAY change freely
- Sealed governance MAY NOT
- Promotion from L2 to L1 requires ratification and ledger append
