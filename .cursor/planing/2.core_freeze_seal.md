"modifications require explicit amendment (additive governance)" - "bypass or
substitution constitutes PRODUCT_AUTHORITY_VIOLATION"

rollup_visibility: - "weekly rollups MAY include sealed hash confirmation" -
"integrity checks SHALL be binary (hash match / no match) when automated"

amendment_triggers: - "any new version of a sealed artifact" - "change to
required fields, record types, or version semantics" - "change to sealing /
hashing procedure"

non_retroactivity: > Applies prospectively from ledger append position. Prior
actions remain valid under governance rules in effect at the time.
