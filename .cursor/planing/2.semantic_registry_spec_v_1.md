# Semantic Registry Specification v1.0 (🧱 ARCH)

**Status:** Draft — Governance Backlog  
**Parent Authority:** NexusCanon Constitution v1.0  
**Applies To:** AXIS, Titan, and governed runtime surfaces  
**Operating Rule:** Additive only · No retroactive meaning · No silent redefinition

---

## 1. Purpose

The Semantic Registry establishes the **canonical authority for meaning** within AXIS‑governed systems.

It exists to:
- prevent semantic drift
- bind rules, thresholds, and concepts to ownership
- separate *meaning* from *implementation*

No rule, threshold, or classification SHALL be enforced unless registered.

---

## 2. Core Invariants (Non‑Negotiable)

1. Meaning SHALL be declared explicitly.
2. Meaning SHALL be versioned and effective‑dated.
3. Meaning SHALL be owned by a named Office.
4. Meaning SHALL be additive; redefinition requires supersession.

---

## 3. Registry Record Types (Minimal Set)

The registry SHALL support only the following record types:

- **CONCEPT** — a named idea with defined meaning
- **RULE** — a deterministic condition or constraint
- **THRESHOLD** — a quantitative or categorical boundary
- **CLASSIFICATION** — a controlled vocabulary entry

No other record types exist unless amended.

---

## 4. Minimum Registry Record (Required Fields)

Every registry entry SHALL include:

- `registry_id` (immutable)
- `record_type`
- `name` (canonical)
- `definition` (deterministic text)
- `owner_office`
- `rationale`
- `evidence_ref[]` (hash‑linked)
- `effective_from` (ISO‑8601)
- `version`
- `supersedes` (optional reference)

---

## 5. Versioning Rules

1. Versions SHALL NOT be retroactive.
2. New versions SHALL explicitly supersede prior ones.
3. Runtime usage SHALL reference:
   - a specific version, or
   - a rule for resolving the active version by effective date.

---

## 6. Enforcement Surface (Titan)

Titan SHALL enforce:
- registration existence for referenced rules or thresholds
- effective date validity at runtime
- immutability of registered records

Titan SHALL NOT infer meaning or auto‑classify.

---

## 7. Non‑Goals

This specification SHALL NOT:
- design an enterprise MDM platform
- define ontologies or knowledge graphs
- implement inference or AI‑driven semantics

---

## 8. Amendment Triggers

Amendment REQUIRED if:
- record types change
- required fields change
- versioning semantics change

---

## 9. Stability Clause

Unregistered meaning SHALL NOT be enforced.

Silence SHALL NOT imply permission.
