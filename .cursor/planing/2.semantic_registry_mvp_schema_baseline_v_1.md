# Semantic Registry — MVP Schema Baseline v1.0 (🧱 ARCH)

**Status:** Draft — Prepared for Ratification  
**Parent:** Semantic Registry Spec v1.0 (ARCH)  
**Purpose:** Freeze the minimum required schema for registry records so Titan
can enforce meaning without ambiguity.  
**Operating Rule:** Additive only · No silent edits · No retroactive meaning

---

## 1. Scope

This baseline defines the **minimum required fields** for all Semantic Registry
records.

It is intentionally minimal. Any additional fields are out of scope until
explicitly elevated by amendment.

---

## 2. Record Types (MVP)

The registry SHALL support only these types:

- `CONCEPT`
- `RULE`
- `THRESHOLD`
- `CLASSIFICATION`

No new record types exist unless amended.

---

## 3. Canonical Fields (MVP — REQUIRED)

Every registry record SHALL include exactly these fields at minimum:

### 3.1 `registry_id`

- **Type:** string
- **Meaning:** Immutable identifier for this record lineage.
- **Constraint:** SHALL never change once issued.

### 3.2 `record_type`

- **Type:** enum (`CONCEPT` | `RULE` | `THRESHOLD` | `CLASSIFICATION`)
- **Constraint:** SHALL be one of the MVP types.

### 3.3 `name`

- **Type:** string
- **Meaning:** Canonical name.
- **Constraint:** SHALL be stable within a lineage unless superseded.

### 3.4 `definition`

- **Type:** string
- **Meaning:** Deterministic text defining meaning.
- **Constraint:** SHALL be explicit; SHALL NOT reference implied context.

### 3.5 `owner_office`

- **Type:** string
- **Meaning:** Accountable Office (not individual).
- **Constraint:** Ownership SHALL be explicit.

### 3.6 `rationale`

- **Type:** string
- **Meaning:** Why this meaning exists.

### 3.7 `evidence_ref[]`

- **Type:** array[string]
- **Meaning:** Hash-linked artifacts supporting the declaration.
- **Constraint:** Each entry SHALL be immutable and content-addressed.

### 3.8 `effective_from`

- **Type:** ISO-8601 datetime string
- **Meaning:** Start of validity.
- **Constraint:** SHALL be present for Titan enforcement.

### 3.9 `version`

- **Type:** string (semver-like)
- **Meaning:** Version within lineage.
- **Constraint:** SHALL be monotonic (no rollback).

### 3.10 `supersedes` (optional)

- **Type:** string (reference to prior `registry_id@version` or equivalent)
- **Meaning:** Explicit linkage to prior record.
- **Constraint:** If present, supersession SHALL be additive (no erasure).

---

## 4. Cross-Document Alignment Requirements

### 4.1 Appendix-A Compatibility

If Appendix-A (Decision metadata extensions) references any controlled
vocabulary:

- those vocabulary entries SHALL exist as `CLASSIFICATION` records in the
  registry
- usage SHALL reference a specific `registry_id@version` OR be resolvable by
  effective date

Silence SHALL NOT imply permission.

---

## 5. Titan Enforcement Surface (Binary Checks)

Titan SHALL fail-fast if any of the following are true:

1. **Unregistered Reference:** A rule/threshold/classification is referenced but
   no registry record exists.
2. **Missing Effective Date:** A referenced record lacks `effective_from`.
3. **Invalid Version Resolution:** Runtime cannot resolve an active version
   (explicit or by effective date rule).
4. **Mutable Record Attempt:** A registry record is modified in-place instead of
   superseded.

Titan SHALL treat these as governance violations and annotate for ledger
readiness.

---

## 6. Amendment Triggers (Anti-Drift)

A new registry record (new version) SHALL be issued when any of the following
changes:

- definition text changes (meaning change)
- threshold value/logic changes
- rule logic changes
- owner_office changes
- evidence set changes materially (new evidence that alters rationale or
  definition)

A constitutional amendment is REQUIRED if:

- required fields change
- record types change
- versioning semantics change

---

## 7. Rollup Integration (Visibility)

Weekly governance rollups SHALL include:

- new registry records created
- records superseded (old → new references)
- ownership transfers
- any Titan enforcement failures related to the registry

---

## 8. Canonical Hash Envelope (Placeholders)

This baseline SHALL be hashed as a canonical artifact.

- `registry_schema_baseline_hash`: HASH_PLACEHOLDER
- `ratification_record_hash`: HASH_PLACEHOLDER
- `ledger_entry_id`: UUID_PLACEHOLDER
