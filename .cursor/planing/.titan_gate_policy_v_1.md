# Titan Gate Policy v1.0 (Operational Enforcement Cadence)

**Status:** Ratified (Option 2 Applied) **Derived From:**

- Titan Protocol v1.0 (Ratified)
- Titan Gate Registry v1.0 + CI Checklist Pack (Operational)
- Amendment A-000 (Foundational Governance) + A-001 (Courts Charter) (Ratified)

**Purpose:** Define **mandatory gate sets by PR scope**, **severity escalation
rules**, **evidence standards**, and **audit cadence**. This policy
operationalizes Titan consistently across teams.

**Non-Doctrine Rule:** This policy introduces no doctrine. It only defines
enforcement behavior for existing gates.

---

## 1. Ownership and Responsibility (By Office and By Team)

### 1.1 Offices (Accountability)

- **Integrity Court Office:** Owns correctness of hard veto conditions for
  integrity clauses (III/IV/V).
- **Execution Court Office:** Owns scope classification and reclassification
  decisions (VIII/IX).
- **Doctrine Court Office:** Owns traceability disputes and alien-doctrine
  vetoes.

### 1.2 Teams (Implementation)

- **Titan Enforcement Team:** Implements and maintains gates
  (lint/CI/runtime/audit).
- **AXIS Product Team:** Supplies required artifacts (PRDs/specs, accounting
  citations, decision memory requirements) and responds to gate failures.

**Rule:** Registry “Primary Owner” SHALL be expressed as **Office + Implementing
Team** (e.g., “Integrity Court + Titan Enforcement Team”).

---

## 2. Evidence Standard (Immutable Artifacts)

All required evidence references SHALL point to **immutable artifacts**.

### 2.1 Acceptable Evidence Forms

- PR/commit/build identifiers (immutable)
- Versioned documents within repo (immutable via git)
- Schema registry snapshots (versioned)
- Test reports stored as build artifacts (immutable)
- Audit scan reports stored as dated snapshots (immutable)

### 2.2 Prohibited Evidence

- Unversioned external docs without version pinning
- Personal links that can change without history
- Ephemeral chat messages

**Rule:** Any gate requiring an evidence link MUST fail (VETO) if evidence
cannot be proven immutable.

---

## 3. Mandatory Gate Sets by PR Scope

A PR SHALL declare scope using the PR Template checkboxes. Titan determines
required gates based on scope.

### 3.1 Scope: Constitution / Governance / Amendments Text Touched

**Mandatory Gates:**

- TITAN-LINT-VIII (VETO-SOFT) — Scope contamination
- TITAN-CI-IX01 (VETO-HARD) — Amendment ID required
- TITAN-CI-IX02 (VETO-HARD) — Additive-only diff

### 3.2 Scope: Workflow / Accounting Logic Changed

**Mandatory Gates:**

- TITAN-CI-II01 (VETO-HARD) — Accounting Truth Citation
- TITAN-LINT-II02 (VETO-HARD) — No invented workflows
- TITAN-CI-III01 (VETO-HARD) — Atomic commit contract
- TITAN-CI-V01 (VETO-HARD) — Decision memory if significant transaction

### 3.3 Scope: Core Write-Path Module Changed (`accounting-core/`, `compliance-core/`, `audit-core/`)

**Mandatory Gates:**

- TITAN-LINT-IV01 (VETO-HARD)
- TITAN-LINT-IV02 (VETO-HARD)
- TITAN-LINT-IV04 (VETO-HARD)
- TITAN-RUNTIME-II03 (VETO-HARD) — if compliance posture logic is touched

### 3.4 Scope: Semantic Intent / Rules Changed

**Mandatory Gates:**

- TITAN-CI-VII01 (VETO-HARD) — semantic registration required
- TITAN-LINT-VII02 (VETO-SOFT) — prefer semantic over UI-only

### 3.5 Scope: Audit Logging Changed

**Mandatory Gates:**

- TITAN-CI-V02 (VETO-HARD) — reasoning context required
- TITAN-AUDIT-V02 (WARN) — completeness scoring baseline

### 3.6 Scope: Compliance Posture / Deviation Behavior Changed

**Mandatory Gates:**

- TITAN-RUNTIME-VI01 (VETO-HARD)
- TITAN-CI-VI02 (VETO-HARD)
- TITAN-RUNTIME-II03 (VETO-HARD)

## 4. WARN Escalation Rules (Codified)

WARN exists only where the Constitution permits variance and the Integrity Court
accepts monitoring.

### 4.1 Escalation Triggers

A WARN SHALL escalate to VETO-HARD if any trigger is met:

- **Repeated Failure:** Same gate emits WARN on **3 consecutive** audit runs.
- **Cumulative Risk:** WARN appears on **5 runs within 30 days**.
- **Regression:** Audit completeness score regression per 4.3.

### 4.2 Escalation Mechanism

- Titan MUST create a ledger-ready record on each WARN.
- On escalation, Titan MUST block release (VETO-HARD) until fixed or amended.

### 4.3 Audit Completeness Tolerance (Configurable)

1. Titan SHALL compute an **Audit Completeness Score (ACS)** for applicable
   audit events:

> **ACS = (count of required audit fields present) / (count of required audit
> fields) × 100**

2. The acceptable ACS baseline SHALL be **configurable** via Titan/AXIS
   configuration, subject to:

- Default baseline: **95%**
- Allowed range: **90%–99%**

3. Any baseline change MUST be:

- **timestamped**
- **attributed** (Office + Team)
- recorded as an **immutable Public Ledger entry** per A-000

4. A **Regression** SHALL be declared if:

- ACS falls below the configured baseline in **two consecutive** runs, OR
- ACS decreases by **≥ 2 percentage points** across **two consecutive** runs.

5. On Regression, Titan SHALL:

- Emit a ledger-ready record including the **baseline value used**, and
- Apply escalation per Section 4.1 triggers.

---

## 5. Audit Cadence (Post-Deploy)

### 5.1 Required Cadence

- **Daily:** TITAN-AUDIT-III01 (orphan intents/facts)
- **Daily:** TITAN-AUDIT-V02 (audit completeness scoring)
- **Release-Time:** Full audit sweep across all AUDIT gates

### 5.2 Emergency Audit

- If an Emergency Amendment is invoked (A-000.9), Titan SHALL run a full sweep
  of **all AUDIT gates** immediately.

---

## 6. Core Write Path Evidence Standard

A change is considered “core write path” if it:

- modifies transaction commit boundaries
- introduces network calls or async queues in the commit path
- changes authoritative persistence logic

**Evidence Required:**

- Diff indicates modules under `accounting-core/`, `compliance-core/`,
  `audit-core/`
- CI report confirms no network hops in write path

---

## 7. Pipeline Output Formats (Human + Machine)

Titan SHALL emit:

1. **Human-readable summary** (as defined in the CI Checklist Format)

2. **Machine-readable JSON** containing:

- `required_gates_by_scope` (the computed required gate set)
- `scope_declaration` (the PR scope flags that determined required gates)
- `gate_results[]` (per-gate verdicts)
- `ledger_records[]` (ledger-ready records per A-000, including
  scope_declaration)

---

## 8. Dispute Resolution

If a gate is disputed:

- The PR is blocked.
- The proposer submits to Courts per A-000.5 order.
- Courts may:
  - Uphold veto
  - Reclassify scope
  - Require Amendment
