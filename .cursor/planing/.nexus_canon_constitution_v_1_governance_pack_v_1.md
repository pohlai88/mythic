## 1. Clause-by-Clause Derivation Map (with Uniform Implementation Notes)

### Article I — Purpose and Telos

#### Clause I.1 — Digital Atelier Mandate
- **Constitution Text:** The system SHALL exist to preserve craftsmanship and amplify human judgment rather than optimize industrial throughput.
- **Origin Term:** Digital Atelier
- **Origin Excerpt:** A unified environment where judgment, craft, and accounting truth cohere.
- **Rationale:** Preserves the system’s telos as judgment-centric.
- **Implementation Note:**
  - **AXIS:** Prioritize decision curation UI over throughput dashboards; require context panels.
  - **Titan:** Reject features that convert judgment into hidden automation.

#### Clause I.2 — Judgment Supremacy
- **Origin Doctrine:** Judgment > Automation
- **Origin Excerpt:** Automation must not bypass accountable human judgment.
- **Rationale:** Prevents silent automation drift.
- **Implementation Note:**
  - **AXIS:** Irreversible actions require explicit confirmation + justification capture.
  - **Titan:** Veto auto-commit flows without recorded rationale.

---

### Article II — Timeless Accounting Truth

#### Clause II.1 — Precedence of Accounting Law
- **Origin Term:** Timeless Accounting Truth
- **Origin Excerpt:** Accounting primitives precede and constrain software behavior.
- **Rationale:** Establishes law-before-code ordering.
- **Implementation Note:**
  - **AXIS:** Workflow UX must surface the accounting primitive it instantiates (e.g., Match / Accrue / Reverse).
  - **Titan:** Veto business flows that cannot map to an accounting primitive.

#### Clause II.2 — Workflow Discovery
- **Origin Doctrine:** Workflows are discovered, not designed
- **Origin Excerpt:** The system does not invent workflows; it codifies immutable truths.
- **Rationale:** Eliminates feature-driven workflow design.
- **Implementation Note:**
  - **AXIS:** Product specs must cite the accounting law + compliance posture, not “user wants a button.”
  - **Titan:** Require “Accounting Truth Citation” for any new workflow.

#### Clause II.3 — Compliance Variance
- **Origin Term:** Compliance as Variable
- **Origin Excerpt:** Compliance adjusts friction, not truth.
- **Rationale:** Flexibility without truth erosion.
- **Implementation Note:**
  - **AXIS:** Provide posture controls (Strict / High-Trust) with visible risk markings.
  - **Titan:** Require permanent “policy deviation” trace fields when bypass occurs.

---

### Article III — Truth and Atomicity

#### Clause III.1 — Atomic Truth Requirement
- **Origin Term:** Atomic Truth
- **Origin Excerpt:** Smallest verifiable unit recorded with provenance.
- **Rationale:** Audit-grade consistency.
- **Implementation Note:**
  - **AXIS:** Every critical action screen must show “what will be committed” as an atomic unit.
  - **Titan:** Veto multi-step commits that can land partial state without compensation.

#### Clause III.2 — No Partial Reality
- **Origin Doctrine:** No distributed truth
- **Origin Excerpt:** Reject fragmentation of business reality.
- **Rationale:** Prevents inconsistent domain realities.
- **Implementation Note:**
  - **AXIS:** Disallow UI states that imply success when truth is pending elsewhere.
  - **Titan:** Veto “eventual” truth for core accounting flows.

---

### Article IV — Architectural Integrity

#### Clause IV.1 — High-Integrity Modulith
- **Origin Term:** High-Integrity Modulith
- **Origin Excerpt:** Single coherent codebase with strict internal boundaries.
- **Rationale:** Preserves epistemic integrity.
- **Implementation Note:**
  - **AXIS:** Product modules must align to domain boundaries; no cross-domain UI shortcuts.
  - **Titan:** Enforce boundary lint rules; no cross-boundary imports.

#### Clause IV.2 — One Runtime (Doctrinal)
- **Origin Doctrine:** One Runtime
- **Origin Excerpt:** Reject distributed coordination for core logic.
- **Rationale:** Deterministic truth boundary.
- **Implementation Note:**
  - **AXIS:** Avoid UX that depends on cross-service orchestration for core commits.
  - **Titan:** Veto internal network hops within core write path.

#### Clause IV.3 — One Database (Doctrinal)
- **Origin Doctrine:** One Database
- **Origin Excerpt:** Single authoritative source of truth.
- **Rationale:** Prevents distributed state errors.
- **Implementation Note:**
  - **AXIS:** Reporting must clearly distinguish “authoritative” vs “derived view.”
  - **Titan:** Veto additional authoritative stores for the same truth.

#### Clause IV.4 — Boundary Enforcement
- **Origin Doctrine:** Hard Domain Boundaries
- **Origin Excerpt:** Domains interact only through declared contracts.
- **Rationale:** Prevents coupling drift.
- **Implementation Note:**
  - **AXIS:** Cross-domain features must declare their contract dependencies explicitly.
  - **Titan:** Veto hidden dependency via shared helpers or direct table access.

### Article V — Decision Memory and Audit

#### Clause V.1 — Decision Memory Mandate
- **Origin Term:** Decision Memory
- **Origin Excerpt:** Capture intent, rationale, alternatives.
- **Rationale:** Institutional memory.
- **Implementation Note:**
  - **AXIS:** Provide “Intent / Rationale / Alternatives” capture UI for significant actions.
  - **Titan:** Require decision memory fields for designated transaction types.

#### Clause V.2 — Epistemological Audit
- **Origin Doctrine:** Audit is epistemological
- **Origin Excerpt:** Audit captures reasoning, not just state.
- **Rationale:** Audit as knowledge.
- **Implementation Note:**
  - **AXIS:** Audit views show both state change and reasoning context.
  - **Titan:** Veto logging that only stores deltas without intent.

---

### Article VI — Compliance as Variable

#### Clause VI.1 — Non-Blocking Principle
- **Origin Doctrine:** Never block legitimate business action
- **Origin Excerpt:** Inform, record, but do not halt.
- **Rationale:** Business continuity.
- **Implementation Note:**
  - **AXIS:** Replace hard-block modals with risk banners + required justification.
  - **Titan:** Veto policy implementations that hard-stop core workflows (except physical impossibility).

#### Clause VI.2 — Accountability Preservation
- **Origin Doctrine:** Deviations must be visible and attributable
- **Origin Excerpt:** Policy bypass permanently recorded.
- **Rationale:** Accountability without paralysis.
- **Implementation Note:**
  - **AXIS:** Deviations appear on transaction header + dashboards.
  - **Titan:** Require immutable deviation flags + actor identity.

---

### Article VII — Business Intent Layer

#### Clause VII.1 — Semantic Authority
- **Origin Term:** Business Intent Layer
- **Origin Excerpt:** Semantic layer above raw data defines meaning.
- **Rationale:** Centralizes meaning.
- **Implementation Note:**
  - **AXIS:** UI labels and behaviors must derive from intent semantics, not hard-coded strings.
  - **Titan:** Veto business rules implemented only in UI without semantic registration.

#### Clause VII.2 — Evolvability
- **Origin Doctrine:** Update semantics, not UI
- **Origin Excerpt:** Behavior evolves via intent updates.
- **Rationale:** Non-disruptive evolution.
- **Implementation Note:**
  - **AXIS:** Product change requests prefer semantic updates over screen redesign.
  - **Titan:** Require a semantic-change path for behavior changes.

---

### Article VIII — Scope of Prohibition

- **Derived From:** Lock vs Release + Illustrative Examples (Non-Normative)
- **Implementation Note:**
  - **AXIS:** Product docs may reference stack; constitutional docs may not.
  - **Titan:** Veto PRs that introduce tech/vendor/perf targets into constitutional text.

---

### Article IX — Amendment and Governance

#### Clause IX.1 — Amendment Exclusivity
- **Derived From:** Additive-only change policy
- **Implementation Note:**
  - **AXIS:** Product changes do not amend Constitution.
  - **Titan:** Require Amendment ID before any constitutional change.

#### Clause IX.2 — Non-Retroactivity
- **Derived From:** Preserve original clauses
- **Implementation Note:**
  - **AXIS:** No UI/feature change may imply a different doctrine.
  - **Titan:** Veto edits that rewrite existing clauses; require additive amendment.
