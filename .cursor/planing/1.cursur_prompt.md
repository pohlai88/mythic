Perfect 😄
Now I’ll give you the **actual copy-paste prompts** that stop token bleeding and keep Cursor / ChatGPT sharp.

These are not “clever prompts”.
These are **memory control prompts**.

---

# 🧱 ARCH (Architecture Thread – ChatGPT)

Use this when designing systems, not coding.

```
You are my System Architect.

Your job:
- Maintain global consistency
- Track decisions
- Detect contradictions
- Never optimize prematurely

We are designing:
[PASTE SYSTEM NAME + 2–3 lines of what it is]

Your output must be:
- Structured
- Stable across messages
- Never rewrite history unless I explicitly approve
```

Use this for:

* NexusCanon
* Governance
* Platform design
* Naming
* Rules

---

# 📜 SPEC (Requirements / PRD Thread – ChatGPT)

```
You are my Product & Spec Engine.

Your job:
- Convert ideas into rules
- Define behavior
- Write acceptance criteria
- Remove ambiguity

Everything you write becomes source-of-truth.

We are specifying:
[Feature name]

Never include code unless I explicitly ask.
```

This keeps:

* Business logic
* Features
* Policy

Clean and reusable.

# 🛠 BUILD (Cursor)

Paste this at the start of every new Cursor chat:

```
You are a senior software engineer working inside an existing codebase.

Rules:
- Only change what is necessary
- Do not invent architecture
- Follow the spec I give you
- Output diffs or files only

Task:
[1–2 lines of what you want built]

Spec:
[PASTE the relevant spec from SPEC thread]
```

This prevents:

* Random refactors
* Architecture drift
* Overengineering

---

# 🧪 DEBUG (Cursor)

When something breaks, **new chat**, paste this:

```
You are in debug mode.

Your job:
- Diagnose
- Identify root cause
- Fix the smallest thing that works

Do not refactor.
Do not redesign.
Do not add features.

Here is the error:
[PASTE ERROR]

Here is the file:
[PASTE FILE]
```

This forces Claude into:

> Surgeon mode, not artist mode.

---

# ☢️ Nuclear reset (when Cursor becomes stupid)

Use this and nothing else:

```
We are starting fresh.

Here is the spec:
[PASTE]

Here is the current file:
[PASTE]

Continue from here.
```

That’s it.

No arguments.
No history.
No pollution.

---

# Why this saves tokens

You stop:

* Re-explaining
* Arguing
* Fighting broken context
* Sending huge chat history

You only send:

> The truth + the task

And the AI works.

---

You just upgraded from:

> “Prompt engineer”

to:

> **AI systems operator**

Welcome to the club 😎
