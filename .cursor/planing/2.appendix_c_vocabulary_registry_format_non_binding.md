# Appendix-C — Vocabulary Registry Format (Non-Binding)

**Status:** Informative — Not Constitutional  
**Parent Authority:** Semantic Registry Spec v1.0 (ARCH)  
**Aligned Baseline:** Semantic Registry MVP Schema Baseline v1.0  
**Scope:** Canonical structure for vocabulary registry entries  
**Operating Rule:** Defines format only · No enforcement unless elevated

---

## C.1 Purpose

This appendix defines the **canonical registry format** for vocabulary entries
governed under Appendix‑B.

Its purpose is to:

- standardize vocabulary representation
- enable deterministic hashing and lineage tracking
- prepare a clean enforcement surface for Titan _without activating it_

This appendix governs **structure**, not semantics or enforcement.

---

## C.2 Applicability

This format applies only to Semantic Registry records of type:

- `CLASSIFICATION`
- `THRESHOLD`

All vocabulary entries SHALL conform to the **Semantic Registry MVP Schema
Baseline v1.0**.

---

## C.3 Canonical Vocabulary Record Structure

A vocabulary entry SHALL be representable in a deterministic JSON or YAML form
with the following fields:

```yaml
registry_id: string # immutable lineage identifier
record_type: CLASSIFICATION|THRESHOLD
name: string # canonical vocabulary name
definition: string # language-stable, standalone meaning
owner_office: string # accountable office
rationale: string # why this vocabulary exists
evidence_ref: # hash-linked supporting artifacts
  - string
version: string # semver-like, monotonic
effective_from: string # ISO-8601 datetime OR ledger position reference
supersedes: string | null # prior registry_id@version (forward-only)
status: active|deprecated # lifecycle state (see C.4)
```

This structure is **illustrative but canonical**.

---

## C.4 Lifecycle States

Vocabulary entries MAY declare a lifecycle state:

- `active` — valid for reference and enforcement
- `deprecated` — historically valid but not recommended for new usage

Rules:

- Deprecation SHALL NOT erase or invalidate historical references.
- Deprecation SHALL be explicit; silence SHALL NOT imply deprecation.

---

## C.5 Cross-Registry Alignment

1. Vocabulary entries SHALL align with the Semantic Registry MVP Schema
   Baseline.
2. References from Appendix‑A or runtime systems SHALL use `registry_id@version`
   or an equivalent resolvable pointer.
3. No vocabulary entry may exist outside the registry.

---

## C.6 Hashing & Canonicalization

Vocabulary records MAY be:

- serialized deterministically
- hashed as immutable artifacts
- referenced by hash in governance ledgers

Canonicalization rules SHALL be declared before enforcement elevation.

---

## C.7 Visibility & Audit

Governance rollups MAY include:

- vocabulary additions
- supersession chains
- deprecated entries
- duplicate-prevention events

Lineage MAY be presented as tables or graphs.

---

## C.8 Non-Goals

This appendix SHALL NOT:

- define enforcement logic
- mandate Titan validation
- introduce inference or auto-classification

---

## C.9 Stability Clause

This appendix may evolve independently.

Changes SHALL NOT affect constitutional law or enforcement unless promoted by
amendment.
