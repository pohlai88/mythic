🧱 **CORE_FREEZE_SEAL — Preimage Checklist (Operator Runbook)** **Mode:** ARCH ·
**Purpose:** Zero-ambiguity, append-safe execution **Rule:** Follow in order. No
skips. No substitutions.

---

## 0) Preconditions

- Core artifacts are **Draft–Stable**.
- Last ledger entry is **finalized** (hash known).
- Canonicalization method is fixed (JCS).

---

## 1) Artifact Hashing (Anchor Truth)

For **each sealed artifact**:

- Normalize content
- Canonicalize (JCS)
- SHA-256
- Lowercase hex
- Format: `sha256:<64-hex>`

☐ AXIS Product Constitution v1.0 ☐ Semantic Registry Spec v1.0 ☐ Freeze Core
Declaration — Draft–Stable ☐ Seal & Ledger Declaration — Core Freeze Binding

**Check:** Recompute on a second machine → hashes **must match**.

---

## 2) Populate Sealed Artifacts

- Paste each computed hash into:
  - `payload.sealed_artifacts[].artifact_hash`

☐ All four hashes inserted ☐ No placeholders remain

---

## 3) Chain Link

- Retrieve **last finalized** ledger entry hash
- Paste into `prev_entry_hash`

☐ `prev_entry_hash` references finalized entry (not draft)

---

## 4) Entry Preimage Preparation

- Fill all fields **except** `entry_hash`
- Ensure:
  - `timestamp_utc` = ISO-8601 UTC (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`)
  - `entry_id` = new UUID
  - `actor_identity` = immutable pubkey fingerprints

- **If upstream spec hashes are unknown:** ☐ Remove `derivation_hash_ref`
  entirely (do not placeholder)

☐ No unresolved placeholders (except `entry_hash`)

---

## 5) Compute Entry Hash (Last)

- Canonicalize the full ledger entry **without** `entry_hash`
- SHA-256 → lowercase hex
- Insert:
  - `entry_hash: sha256:<64-hex>`

**Check:** Recompute on a second machine → hash **must match**.

---

## 6) Final Sanity Checks

☐ Artifact hashes match across machines ☐ Entry hash matches across machines ☐
Timestamp is UTC (`...Z`) ☐ UUID is unique ☐ No dangling fields (especially
derivations)

---

## 7) Append

- Append the entry to the public ledger
- Record append confirmation
- Preserve canonical preimage bytes as an immutable build artifact (off-ledger)

---

## 8) Post-Append Visibility

- Include in next weekly rollup:
  - Sealed artifact names + hashes
  - Freeze integrity confirmation (binary: match / no match)

---

**END — OPERATOR RUNBOOK** _If any check fails, stop. Correct. Recompute. Do not
append._
