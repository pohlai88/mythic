Good — this is where you stop being frustrated and start being **dangerous** 😈
Here is the **real operating system for AI-assisted engineering**.

This is not theory. This is how elite teams and serious builders avoid “AI
dementia”.

# 🧠 The AI Session Architecture

You must treat AI like **human engineers**.

You don’t ask:

> One person to design, code, debug, and document everything in one brain for 6
> hours.

You use **roles + clean rooms**.

Same with AI.

# 🔱 The 4-Thread System (this is the secret)

You always maintain **four separate chats**:

| Thread               | Purpose                                  | When to use           |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **A — Architecture** | Vision, data model, system design, rules | Before coding         |
| **B — Build**        | Write features, implement, generate code | While coding          |
| **C — Debug**        | Fix errors, failing tests, broken builds | When something breaks |
| **D — Spec**         | PRDs, requirements, governance, docs     | When formalizing      |

Never mix them.

Ever.

# Why mixing kills intelligence

When you mix:

- Design
- Errors
- Logs
- Code
- Revisions
- Requirements

You create:

> Context soup

The model can’t tell:

- What is rule
- What is outdated
- What is failure
- What is final

So it guesses. And guessing = stupidity.

# 🧠 How Cursor should be used

## Cursor Chat #1 → Build thread

Used only for:

- “Implement this”
- “Refactor this”
- “Write this file”
- “Apply this patch”

If it starts arguing architecture: **Stop.** Take it to Architecture thread.

---

## Cursor Chat #2 → Debug thread

New chat. Only:

- Error
- Stack trace
- Test failure
- Logs

Never include:

- Old instructions
- Old design
- Large conversations

Just:

> “Here is the failure. Fix it.”

This keeps Claude laser-focused.

---

# 🧠 ChatGPT browser → Architecture thread

This is where you and I belong 😏

We do:

- System design
- PRDs
- Governance
- Schema
- Naming
- Rules
- Philosophy

We do NOT paste error logs here.

We do NOT paste 2,000 lines of code here.

This thread must stay **pure**.

---

# 🔥 The Nuclear Rule

> **When the AI starts repeating, contradicting, or “feeling dumb”: RESET.**

Open a new thread.

Feed it:

- The current spec
- The current file
- The current goal

You will get:

> 10× better output in 30 seconds than arguing for 30 minutes.

# 🧬 How elite engineers work with AI

They do this:

```
Design in Thread A
↓
Hand spec to Thread B
↓
If broken → Thread C
↓
If policy changes → Thread A
↓
If writing docs → Thread D
```

This is how you keep:

- Coherence
- Memory
- Intelligence

---

# 💀 What 99% of users do

One endless chat:

- Architecture
- Bugs
- Ideas
- Code
- Logs
- Random thoughts

This destroys the context window.

The AI becomes:

> A drunk intern with Alzheimer’s

---

# The punchline

You didn’t imagine it.

The AI wasn’t “sometimes dumb”.

You were just unknowingly **corrupting its memory**.

Now you know how to keep it sharp.

workflow and tab strategy.**
