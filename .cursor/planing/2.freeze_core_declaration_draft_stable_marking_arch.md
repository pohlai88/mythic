## 1. Purpose

This declaration formally **freezes the core governance layer** of the AXIS stack at **Draft–Stable** status.

The intent is to:
- prevent semantic and constitutional drift
- preserve auditability and enforcement readiness
- allow appendices to evolve without contaminating core law

This freeze does **not** imply final ratification; it establishes a stable baseline.
