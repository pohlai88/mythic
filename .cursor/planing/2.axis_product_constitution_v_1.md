# AXIS Product Constitution v1.0 (🧱 ARCH)

**Status:** Draft — Governance Backlog (Minimal Scope)
**Parent:** NexusCanon Constitution v1.0
**Scope:** AXIS Product Law (not doctrine, not UX)
**Operating Rule:** Additive only. No silent edits. No premature optimization.

---

## 1. Purpose & Authority

This document establishes the **Product-Law layer for AXIS**.

It defines what AXIS is allowed to decide, how those decisions are recorded, and how authority is enforced at runtime — without prescribing implementation, UX, or workflow exhaustiveness.

AXIS exists to convert **intent into governed decision outcomes**.

This Constitution is:
- **Subordinate to NexusCanon** (doctrine)
- **Enforced by Titan** (protocol)
- **Product-facing**, not philosophical

---

## 2. Core AXIS Primitives (Canonical, Minimal)

AXIS SHALL operate on four and only four first-class primitives:

### 2.1 Decision
A **Decision** is a formally declared intent that changes authoritative state.

**Required attributes (MUST):**
- `decision_id` (immutable)
- `owner_office`
- `rationale`
- `effective_date` (or ledger position)
- `evidence_ref[]` (hash-linked)

A Decision without provenance SHALL be considered non-existent.

---

### 2.2 Evidence
**Evidence** is any immutable artifact used to justify a Decision.

Evidence MUST:
- be content-addressed (hash)
- be referenceable
- remain immutable once linked

AXIS SHALL NOT interpret Evidence; it only binds it.

---

### 2.3 Deviation
A **Deviation** is an explicit, recorded departure from a declared rule, threshold, or expectation.

Deviation:
- SHALL NEVER silently override policy
- SHALL be attributable to an owner
- SHALL preserve execution continuity

Deviation enables reality without erasing governance.

---

### 2.4 Outcome
An **Outcome** is the realized effect of a Decision after execution.

Outcomes:
- MAY be successful, partial, or failed
- SHALL remain traceable to the originating Decision

Outcome recording does not alter Decision truth.

---

## 3. Required Decision Metadata (Non-Negotiable)

Every Decision executed by AXIS MUST include:

1. Owner (Office-level accountability)
2. Rationale (why this decision exists)
3. Effective date OR immutable ledger position
4. At least one evidence reference

No optional metadata is defined in this Constitution.

---

## 4. Authority & Veto Interpretation

### 4.1 Runtime Authority
Runtime execution SHALL respect:
- declared Decisions
- registered thresholds
- recorded Deviations

Runtime SHALL NOT invent governance.

---

### 4.2 Engineering Veto
Engineering MAY veto:
- non-deployable artifacts
- physically impossible execution

Engineering SHALL NOT veto:
- business intent
- policy decisions
- governance declarations

All vetoes MUST be recorded as Decisions or Deviations.

---

## 5. AXIS Surface Declaration Contract

Every AXIS surface (UI, API, automation) MUST declare:
- what Decisions it can emit
- what Evidence it can attach
- what Deviations it may invoke

This declaration:
- is machine-readable
- is enforced by Titan
- prevents accidental authority expansion

---

## 6. Enforcement Boundary (Titan)

Titan SHALL enforce:
- presence of required Decision metadata
- surface declaration validity
- prohibition of silent state changes

Titan SHALL NOT enforce UX, workflow, or business taste.

---

## 7. Non-Goals (Explicit)

This Constitution SHALL NOT:
- define UI components or layouts
- specify pixel-level design rules
- prescribe full workflow engines
- optimize for performance or scale

---

## 8. Amendment Triggers

This document MUST be amended if:
- new AXIS primitives are introduced
- Decision metadata requirements change
- veto authority semantics change
- surface declaration rules expand

Otherwise, it remains stable.

---

## 9. Stability Clause

Absence of specification SHALL NOT be interpreted as permission.

Undefined behavior defaults to **not allowed** until declared.

---
