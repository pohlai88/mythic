# Getting Started

This guide demonstrates the **Page File Convention** for documentation pages.

## Page File Convention Structure

When using Page File Convention, your file structure looks like this:

```
app/
├── guides/
│   └── getting-started/
│       └── page.mdx      ← This file
└── [[...mdxPath]]/
    └── page.tsx          ← Catch-all route (Content Directory Convention)
```

## Key Points

1. **Metadata Required**: All `page.{md,mdx}` files must export metadata
2. **File Location = Route**: `app/guides/getting-started/page.mdx` → `/guides/getting-started`
3. **Colocation**: Keep related assets in the same directory
4. **Works with Content Directory**: Both conventions can coexist

## Example Metadata
