# Example: Page File Convention

This page demonstrates the **Page File Convention** approach in Nextra v4.

## How It Works

- File location: `app/example-page-convention/page.mdx`
- Route: `/example-page-convention`
- Metadata: Exported in frontmatter (required)

## Benefits

- ✅ Colocation: Keep assets with pages
- ✅ Better organization for complex pages
- ✅ Direct file-based routing
- ✅ Metadata exported automatically

## Structure

```
app/
└── example-page-convention/
    ├── page.mdx          ← This file
    └── assets/           ← Can colocate assets here
```

## Metadata Export

All `page.{md,mdx}` files **must** export metadata. This is done via frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: 'Page Title'
description: 'Page description'
---
```
