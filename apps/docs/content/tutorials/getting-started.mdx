# Getting Started with the Design System

In this tutorial, we will build a form together using our design system.

## Step 1: Import the Button Component

First, we import the Button component from our design system:

```typescript
import { Button } from '@mythic/design-system/components'
```

## Step 2: Create the Form Structure

Next, we create a basic form structure:

```typescript
export function MyForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <input type="text" />
      <Button>Submit</Button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

## Step 3: Add Validation

Finally, we add Zod validation to ensure data integrity:

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod/v4'

const formSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1),
})

// ... validation logic
```

## What We Learned

We've built a complete form with validation using our design system. In the next tutorial, we'll explore advanced form patterns.
