# Governance Documentation

Welcome to the NexusCanon-AXIS governance documentation. This section contains all governance-related documents organized by layer.

## Document Layers

### Layer 0 (L0) - Foundational

Core philosophical principles and immutable values that define the system's identity. These documents are **sealed** and cannot be modified without formal amendment procedures.

- [LBOS Origin Paper](/governance/sealed/lbos-origin-paper) - Philosophical foundation

### Layer 1 (L1) - Constitutional

Governance rules and operational frameworks that derive from L0 principles. These documents establish the rules of governance.

- [NexusCanon Constitution](/governance/sealed/nexus-canon-constitution) - Single source of truth
- [Titan Protocol](/governance/sealed/titan-protocol) - Core operational protocol

### Layer 2 (L2) - Operational

Active planning and implementation documents. These are living documents that guide day-to-day operations.

- [Planning Playbook](/governance/active/planning-playbook) - Reference benchmarks and tracking

## Amendments

View the [Amendment History](/governance/amendments) for all governance amendments.

## Verification

All sealed documents include:
- **SHA-256 Hash** - Verify document integrity
- **Ledger Entry ID** - Track in public ledger
- **Effective Date** - When document became active
