# Why Server Components?

This document explains the reasoning behind our Server Components architecture.

## The Problem

Traditional React applications ship all component code to the browser, even when components don't need interactivity. This increases bundle size and slows initial page load.

## The Solution

Server Components run on the server and send zero JavaScript to the browser. Only Client Components (marked with `'use client'`) are shipped to the browser.

## Benefits

1. **Smaller Bundle Size**: Server Components don't add to client bundle
2. **Faster Initial Load**: Less JavaScript to download and parse
3. **Direct Database Access**: Server Components can access databases directly
4. **Better Security**: Sensitive logic stays on the server

## When to Use Server Components

- ✅ Data fetching
- ✅ Static content
- ✅ Server-side logic
- ❌ Event handlers (use Client Components)
- ❌ Browser APIs (use Client Components)
- ❌ State hooks (use Client Components)

## Architecture Decision

We chose Server Components as the default because:
- Next.js 16+ provides excellent support
- Reduces bundle size significantly
- Aligns with our performance goals
- Simplifies data fetching patterns
