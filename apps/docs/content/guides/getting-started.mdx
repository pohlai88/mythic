# Getting Started

This guide helps you get started with NexusCanon-AXIS governance documentation.

## Understanding the Layers

NexusCanon-AXIS organizes documents into three layers:

### Layer 0 (L0) - Foundational

Core philosophical principles. These are **immutable** and represent the system's fundamental values.

### Layer 1 (L1) - Constitutional

Governance rules and frameworks. These establish how the system operates and can be amended with formal approval.

### Layer 2 (L2) - Operational

Active planning and implementation documents. These are living documents that guide day-to-day work.

## Navigating the Documentation

1. **Governance** - Core governance documents and amendments
2. **Product** - Product features and roadmap
3. **Guides** - How-to guides (you are here)

## Key Concepts

### Sealed Documents

Sealed documents are immutable. Each sealed document has:

- SHA-256 hash for verification
- Ledger entry ID for tracking
- Effective date

### Amendments

Changes to sealed documents require formal amendments. See [Creating Amendments](./amendments).

## Next Steps

- Read the [LBOS Origin Paper](/governance/sealed/lbos-origin-paper)
- Review the [NexusCanon Constitution](/governance/sealed/nexus-canon-constitution)
- Learn about [Sealing Documents](./sealing-documents)
