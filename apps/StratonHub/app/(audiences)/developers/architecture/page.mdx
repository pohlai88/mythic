# Architecture

> System boundaries, invariants, and architectural decisions

## Overview

This section documents the architectural foundations of NexusCanon.
Understanding these principles is essential for maintaining system integrity.

## Core Principles

### 1. Boundary Enforcement

Every domain has explicit boundaries:

- **Data boundaries**: What data each domain owns
- **API boundaries**: How domains communicate
- **Event boundaries**: What events each domain emits

### 2. Invariant Protection

System invariants that must never be violated:

- **Audit trail completeness**: Every action must be traced
- **Authorization consistency**: Permissions are never bypassed
- **Data integrity**: Referential integrity is maintained

### 3. Trade-off Documentation

Every architectural decision documents:

- What we gained
- What we sacrificed
- Why this trade-off was acceptable

## System Structure

### Communication Patterns

| Pattern      | Use Case          | Example               |
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Sync API     | Real-time queries | Get proposal status   |
| Async Events | State changes     | Proposal approved     |
| Saga         | Multi-domain ops  | Cross-domain approval |

## Guarantees

### What is Guaranteed

- **Consistency**: Eventually consistent within 5 seconds
- **Durability**: All committed data is persisted
- **Auditability**: Complete trace for all operations

### What is Optional

- **Real-time sync**: Not guaranteed for cross-domain queries
- **Order preservation**: Events may arrive out of order
- **Exactly-once**: At-least-once delivery (idempotency required)

## Decision Records

Key architectural decisions are documented in ADRs:

- [ADR-001: Event-Driven Architecture](/developers/architecture/adrs/001) —
  Primary communication pattern between domains
- [ADR-002: Domain Boundary Definition](/developers/architecture/adrs/002) —
  Explicit contracts and data ownership
- [ADR-003: Saga Pattern](/developers/architecture/adrs/003) — Cross-domain
  operation coordination

> **Source of Truth**: ADR files are maintained in `docs/governance/decisions/`
