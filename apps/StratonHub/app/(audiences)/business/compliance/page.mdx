# Compliance & Audit

> Audit models, trace discipline, override recording, and the rules that
> preserve accountability

## Overview

This section defines the compliance framework for NexusCanon and AXIS. Every
decision, every action, every override is recorded and auditable.

**Principle**: _What cannot be traced cannot be trusted._

## Audit Model

### Immutable Trace

Every system action generates an immutable trace record:

- **Actor** — Who performed the action
- **Action** — What was done
- **Target** — What was affected
- **Timestamp** — When it occurred
- **Context** — Business justification

### Override Recording

When standard procedures are bypassed:

1. Override reason must be documented
2. Approver must be identified
3. Impact assessment required
4. Time-bound expiration enforced
