## Introduction

We are going to build a form using our design system. This tutorial will take you through the process step by step. We will use Tailwind CSS for styling and Zod for validation.

    {
      title: "First, import the Button component",
      description: "We must import the Button component from our design system before we can use it.",

      code: `export function MyForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <input type="text" />
      <Button>Submit</Button>
    </form>
  )
}`
    },
    {
      title: "Finally, add Zod validation",
      description: "We must add validation to ensure data integrity. This is critical for form security.",
      code: `import { z } from 'zod/v4'

const formSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1),
})

// ... validation logic`,
      note: "Remember: Always validate user input on both client and server"
    }
  ]}
/>

## What We Built

You have built a secure, validated form using our design system. We used:

- ✅ **Button component** from the design system
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- ✅ **Zod validation** for data integrity

In the next tutorial, we'll explore advanced form patterns and intelligence-driven styling.
