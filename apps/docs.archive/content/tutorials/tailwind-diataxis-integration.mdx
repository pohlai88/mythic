## Introduction

We are going to create a documentation page that demonstrates the synergistic integration of Tailwind CSS v4, Diátaxis framework, and Nextra 4. By the end of this tutorial, you will understand how these three systems work together to create beautiful, intelligent documentation.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:

- Nextra 4 installed in your docs app
- Tailwind CSS v4 configured
- Diátaxis components available in MDX

## Step 1: Understanding the Structure

First, we need to understand how Diátaxis organizes documentation into four types:

<TutorialSteps
  steps={[
    {
      title: "Tutorials (Learning-Oriented)",
      description: "We use tutorials when we want to teach someone how to accomplish a task from scratch. They use first-person plural ('we will build X together').",
      code: `<DocumentTypeBadge type="tutorial" />`
    },
    {
      title: "How-To Guides (Problem-Oriented)",
      description: "We use how-to guides when someone knows what they want to do but needs guidance. They are goal-focused and problem-solving.",
      code: `<DocumentTypeBadge type="how-to" />`
    },
    {
      title: "Reference (Information-Oriented)",
      description: "We use reference when someone needs to look up specific information. They are technical and factual.",
      code: `<DocumentTypeBadge type="reference" />`
    },
    {
      title: "Explanation (Understanding-Oriented)",
      description: "We use explanation when someone wants to understand why something works the way it does. They provide background and reasoning.",
      code: `<DocumentTypeBadge type="explanation" />`
    }
  ]}
/>

## Step 2: Using Tailwind Utilities

Now that we understand the structure, we will use Tailwind CSS utilities to style our documentation. Tailwind provides intelligence-driven utilities that adapt to document types.

Notice that we can use Diátaxis-specific utilities:

```tsx
// Tutorial styling
<div className="diataxis-tutorial p-4 rounded-lg">
  Tutorial content
</div>

// How-To styling  
<div className="diataxis-howto p-4 rounded-lg">
  How-To content
</div>
```

We can also combine them with intelligence-driven utilities:

```tsx
<div className="diataxis-tutorial gradient-success transition-illuminate">
  Tutorial with intelligence-driven styling
</div>
```

## Step 3: Building a Complete Page

Now that we understand both systems, we will build a complete documentation page. We will use Diátaxis components enhanced with Tailwind styling.

<ExplanationBox type="concept" title="Why This Works">
  The synergy comes from Diátaxis providing structure, Tailwind providing styling,
  and Nextra providing the platform. Together, they create documentation that is both
  well-organized and beautifully styled.
</ExplanationBox>

## Step 4: Testing the Integration

Finally, we should test that everything works together. Notice how:

1. **Diátaxis** organizes the content structure
2. **Tailwind** provides consistent, intelligent styling
3. **Nextra** renders everything beautifully

## What We Built

You have built a secure, three-layer documentation system that combines:

- ✅ **Diátaxis structure** for clear organization
- ✅ **Tailwind CSS v4** for intelligence-driven styling
- ✅ **Nextra 4** for powerful documentation platform

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the integration, you can:

1. Create your own tutorial pages using `<TutorialSteps>`
2. Create how-to guides using `<HowToGuide>`
3. Create reference pages using `<ReferenceTable>`
4. Create explanation pages using `<ExplanationBox>`

Remember: Always use the appropriate document type badge and follow Diátaxis language conventions for maximum effect.
