# LBOS Origin Paper

## Purpose

This document establishes the philosophical foundation for the NexusCanon-AXIS governance system.

## Core Principles

### 1. Judgment Supremacy

Human judgment remains supreme in all governance decisions. AI systems serve as advisors, not decision-makers.

### 2. Decision Memory

All significant decisions must be recorded and traceable. The governance system maintains institutional memory.

### 3. Anti-Premature Optimization

Solve today's problems with today's tools. Do not over-engineer for hypothetical future requirements.

### 4. High-Integrity Modulith

Maintain a single codebase with strict boundaries. Avoid premature microservice decomposition.
