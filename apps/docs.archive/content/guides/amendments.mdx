# Creating Amendments

This guide explains how to propose amendments to governance documents.

## When to Propose an Amendment

Propose an amendment when:

- A sealed document needs modification
- New governance rules are needed
- Existing rules need clarification

## Amendment Process

### Step 1: Draft Proposal

Create a new amendment file:

```
pages/governance/amendments/a-XXX-your-amendment.mdx
```

Include:

- Clear title
- Rationale for change
- Specific proposed changes
- Impact analysis

### Step 2: Add to _meta.json

Update `pages/governance/amendments/_meta.json`:

```json
{
  "a-xxx-your-amendment": "A-XXX: Your Amendment Title"
}
```

### Step 3: Review Period

- Minimum 7 days for L1 documents
- Minimum 14 days for L0 documents
- Collect stakeholder feedback

### Step 4: Discussion

- Address comments and concerns
- Revise proposal if needed
- Document all discussions

### Step 5: Voting

Required approvals:

| Layer | Approval Required |
|-------|-------------------|
| L0 | Supermajority (75%) |
| L1 | Majority (50%+1) |
| L2 | Standard review |

### Step 6: Implementation

If approved:

1. Update target document
2. Recompute hash
3. Update ledger entries
4. Mark amendment as ratified
