# Sealing Documents

This guide explains how to seal governance documents for immutability.

## Prerequisites

- Document content finalized
- Required approvals obtained
- Ledger system access

## Sealing Process

### Step 1: Prepare Document

Ensure your document:

1. Has complete content
2. Includes required frontmatter
3. References appropriate layers

### Step 2: Compute Hash

```bash
# Compute SHA-256 hash
pnpm compute-hash pages/governance/sealed/your-document.mdx
```

### Step 3: Add Frontmatter

```yaml
---
title: Your Document Title
status: sealed
layer: L1
document_hash: sha256:your-computed-hash
ledger_entry_id: urn:uuid:generated-uuid
effective_date: 2024-01-01
version: "1.0"
---
```

### Step 4: Create Ledger Entry

Create an entry in the public ledger with:

- Document title
- Hash
- Effective date
- Approvers

### Step 5: Add Seal Component

```mdx
import { SealedDocument } from '@/components/governance'

<SealedDocument
  title="Your Document Title"
  hash="your-computed-hash"
  ledgerEntryId="urn:uuid:your-entry-id"
  effectiveDate="2024-01-01"
  layer="L1"
/>
```

### Step 6: Commit and Deploy

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Seal: Your Document Title v1.0"
git push
```

## Verification

After sealing, verify:

1. Hash matches computed value
2. Ledger entry exists
3. Component displays correctly

## Modifying Sealed Documents

Sealed documents cannot be directly modified. To change a sealed document:

1. Create an amendment proposal
2. Follow [amendment process](./amendments)
3. If approved, create new version
