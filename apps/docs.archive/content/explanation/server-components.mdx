<ExplanationBox type="problem" title="The Problem">
  Traditional React applications ship all component code to the browser, even when components don't need interactivity. This increases bundle size and slows initial page load, especially for content-heavy applications like documentation sites.
</ExplanationBox>

<ExplanationBox type="concept" title="The Solution">
  Server Components run on the server and send zero JavaScript to the browser. Only Client Components (marked with `'use client'`) are shipped to the browser. This creates a clear separation between server-rendered content and interactive client-side features.
</ExplanationBox>

## Benefits

1. **Smaller Bundle Size**: Server Components don't add to client bundle
2. **Faster Initial Load**: Less JavaScript to download and parse
3. **Direct Database Access**: Server Components can access databases directly
4. **Better Security**: Sensitive logic stays on the server

## When to Use Server Components

- ✅ Data fetching
- ✅ Static content
- ✅ Server-side logic
- ❌ Event handlers (use Client Components)
- ❌ Browser APIs (use Client Components)
- ❌ State hooks (use Client Components)

<ExplanationBox type="rationale" title="Architecture Decision">
  We chose Server Components as the default because:
  
  - Next.js 16+ provides excellent support with App Router
  - Reduces bundle size significantly (critical for documentation sites)
  - Aligns with our performance goals
  - Simplifies data fetching patterns
  - Enables better SEO for content-heavy pages
