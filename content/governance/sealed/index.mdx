# Sealed Documents

Sealed documents are **immutable** governance documents that have been formally approved and cannot be modified without going through the amendment process.

## Document Characteristics

- ✅ **Hash Verified** - Each document has a SHA-256 hash for integrity verification
- ✅ **Ledger Tracked** - All sealed documents are recorded in the public ledger
- ✅ **Version Controlled** - Clear version history and effective dates
- ✅ **Amendment Protected** - Changes require formal amendment procedure

## Layer 0 Documents

These foundational documents define the core philosophical principles:

| Document | Status | Effective Date |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| [LBOS Origin Paper](./lbos-origin-paper) | 🔒 Sealed | 2024-01-01 |

## Layer 1 Documents

These constitutional documents establish governance rules:

| Document | Status | Effective Date |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| [NexusCanon Constitution](./nexus-canon-constitution) | 🔒 Sealed | 2024-01-15 |
| [Titan Protocol](./titan-protocol) | 🔒 Sealed | 2024-02-01 |

## Verification

To verify a sealed document:

1. Copy the document hash
2. Compute the SHA-256 hash of the document content
3. Compare the hashes - they must match exactly
